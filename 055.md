## The Merciful

In the Name of God, the All-Merciful, the Most Merciful.

1. The All-Merciful
2. taught the Recitation,
3. created the man,
4. taught the Expression.
5. The Sun and the Moon are gathered
6. and the Stars and the Trees bow down.
7. And the Heaven He raised up and He established the Balance.
8. "That ye may not lack on the Balance
9. and establish a just weight and don't make the Balance deficit."
10. And the Earth He put to sleep.
11. Therein the fruit and date-palms are sheathed
12. and the seeds are blown away, and the fragrant plants.
13. So which Alás, your Lords, will ye contradict?
14. He created the man out of clay like a potter.
15. And created the genie from the current of fire.
16. So which Alás, your Lords, will ye contradict?
17. Lord of the East and Lord of the West.
18. So which Alás, your Lords, will ye contradict?
19. The pastures of the seas He brought together,
20. between them the isthmus unharmed.
21. So which Alás, your Lords, will ye contradict?
22. Out of them come Pearl and Coral.
23. So which Alás, your Lords, will ye contradict?
24. And He endeavours vicinity over the seas as a sign.
25. So which Alás, your Lords, will ye contradict?
26. All on it will perish.
27. Only the Countenance of the Lord remains, possessed of Majesty and Glory.
28. So which Alás, your Lords, will ye contradict?
29. Ask Him who is in Heaven and on Earth. Each day is in His likeness.
30. So which Alás, your Lords, will ye contradict?
31. Soon the end comes to you, oh weighted ones!
32. So which Alás, your Lords, will ye contradict?
33. Oh people of the genies and mankind. If ye can pass beyond the regions of the Heavens and the Earth, then pass. Ye cannot pass except with authority.
34. So which Alás, your Lords, will ye contradict?
35. There will be sent to you a flash of fire and brass, and ye cannot prevail.
36. So which Alás, your Lords, will ye contradict?

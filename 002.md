1. Alif, Lám, Mím
2. That is the Book, no doubt in it, which guideth the pious ones
3. who believe in the unseen, are steadfast in prayer and spend from what We have given them,
4. and who believe in what hath been sent down to thee, and what hath been sent down from before thee, and believe firmly in the Hereafter,
5. those on guidance from their Lord and those, they prosper.

# Ar-Rahman
## The Merciful

In the Name of God, the All-Merciful, the Most Merciful.

1. The All-Merciful
2. taught the Recitation,
3. created the man,
4. taught the Expression.
5. The Sun and the Moon are gathered
6. and the Stars and the Trees bow down.
7. And the Heaven He raised up and He established the Balance.
8. "That ye may not lack on the Balance
9. and establish a just weight and don't make the Balance deficit."
10. And the Earth He put to sleep.
11. Therein the fruit and date-palms are sheathed
12. and the seeds are blown away, and the fragrant plants.
13. So which Alás, your Lords, will ye contradict?
14. He created the man out of clay like a potter.
15. And created the genie from the current of fire.
16. So which Alás, your Lords, will ye contradict?
17. Lord of the East and Lord of the West.
18. So which Alás, your Lords, will ye contradict?
19. The pastures of the seas He brought together.

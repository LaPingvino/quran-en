2. This Book, without doubt in it, guideth the pious ones
3. who believe in the unseen, are steadfast in prayer and spend from what We have given them,
4. and who believe in what hath been sent down to thee, and what hath been sent down from before thee, and believe firmly in the Hereafter,
5. those guided by their Lord, and they are who do well.
6. Verily, those who don't believe, it's the same to them whether thou warn them or not, they don't believe.
7. A seal God put on their hearts and on their hearing and their sight is veiled. And for them is a great punishment.
8. And of the People who say "We believe in God and the Last Day", but they don't believe.
9. They try to deceive God and the Believers, and they deceive not but themselves, and they don't realize.

1. In the Name of God, the All-Merciful, the Most Merciful.
2. Praise be to God, the Lord of the Worlds,
3. the All-Merciful, the Most Merciful,
4. sovereign of the Day of Judgement.
5. Only Thee we adore and only Thee we beseech for help.
6. Guide us to the Straight Path,
7. the Path of those whom Thou hast favored, not of those who caused Thy anger to themselves, nor of those that go astray.

# An English translation of the Qur'an for study purposes

The Qur'an has been translated many times to English and other languages, but none of these translations is particularly satisfying for study purposes. They tend to do a bad job of conveying anything else than common understanding of the Qur'an. For a new age, we need a Qur'an translation that permits opening the gates for futher study in the source texts, and makes hidden meanings more evident, as well as using the Qur'an liturgically in the Bahá'í world easier and more fitting with the rest of the texts.

## The Sent Ones

In the Name of God, the All-Merciful, the Most Merciful.

1. By those sent one after another
2. and the violent blows
3. and the scattering far and wide
4. and the Measure of separation 
5. and the descendance of the Reminder
6. which holds for true or warns:
7. verily, what We promised ye shall pass.
8. So when the stars shall be estinguished
9. and the heaven is riven asunder
10. and the mountains are blown away
11. and the messengers assemble:
12. For what day hath been set?
13. For the Day of Judgement.
14. And what will tell the Day of Judgement?
15. Woe, that Day, to the deniers.
16. Did We not destroy the former,
17. then let the latter follow?
18. Thus We deal with the wicked.
19. Woe, that Day, to the deniers.
20. Did we not create you from a despicable drop
21. which we put in a safe abode
22. for a fixed time?
23. Thus We measure, and We measure best.
24. Woe, that Day, to the deniers.
25. Didn't we make the Earth receiving
26. both living and dead?
27. And We made therein firm and lofty mountains, and We gave ye sweet water to drink.
28. Woe, that Day, to the deniers.
29. Go in to what ye used to deny.
30. Go in to the three-pillared shadow.
31. Not a fresh shadow, not availing against the flame.
32. Verily, it sendeth out sparks like a fortress,
33. like yellow camels.
34. Woe, that Day, to the deniers.
35. This day they will not speak
36. and they will not be permitted to excuse themselves.
37. Woe, that Day, to the deniers.
38. This is the Day of Judgement: we have collected ye and the former.
39. So if ye have a plan, use it against Me.
40. Woe, that Day, to the deniers.
41. Indeed, the righteous are in shades and spring
42. and fruits from what they desire.
43. Eat and drink happily for what ye used to do.
44. Verily, thus we recompense those who do good.
45. Woe, that Day, to the deniers.
46. Eat and enjoy some, verily ye are wicked.
47. Woe, that Day, to the deniers.
48. And when it is said, bow, they bow not.
49. Woe, that Day, to the deniers.
50. Then in what later message do they believe?

## The Merciful

In the Name of God, the All-Merciful, the Most Merciful.

1. The All-Merciful
2. taught the Recitation,
3. created the man,
4. taught the Expression.
5. The Sun and the Moon are gathered
6. and the Stars and the Trees bow down.
7. And the Heaven He raised up and He established the Balance.
8.
